# 📊 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab Programs

This repository contains a complete set of DSA programs implemented in **C and C++**, based on university lab curriculum. The programs cover key data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, expression conversion, binary search, graphs, and hashing — essential for both academics and coding interviews.
